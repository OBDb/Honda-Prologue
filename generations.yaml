    description: "The Honda Prologue is the brand's first volume all-electric SUV for the North American market, developed in partnership with General Motors and utilizing GM's Ultium battery and electric vehicle platform. Positioned as a midsize crossover SUV, it features clean, minimalist styling that establishes a distinct electric vehicle design language for Honda while maintaining brand recognition. The exterior incorporates aerodynamic elements including a closed-off front fascia (as no traditional grille is needed for engine cooling), flush door handles, and sculpted sides to maximize efficiency and range. Powered by a dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing 288 HP and 333 lb-ft of torque, it offers competitive performance for its class. The 85 kWh battery provides an EPA-estimated range of 296 miles in front-wheel drive configuration and 273 miles with all-wheel drive. Charging capabilities include DC fast charging at up to 155 kW, allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 40 minutes. The interior features a minimalist, tech-focused design with a standard 11.3-inch digital instrument display and 11.3-inch infotainment touchscreen with Google Built-in services. The cabin emphasizes spaciousness with a generous 119.8 cubic feet of passenger volume and 25.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. Available in various trim levels including Elite, Touring, and Sport, it offers features like heated and ventilated seats, a panoramic roof, and a comprehensive suite of Honda Sensing safety technologies. As Honda's transition vehicle toward full electrification (before introducing models on its own e:Architecture platform), the Prologue represents an important strategic step for the company despite using GM's technology. The name 'Prologue' intentionally signals that this model serves as an introduction to Honda's broader electric vehicle strategy that will unfold in coming years."
